I'm a recent comp-sci graduate who loves low level and functional
programming. I have experience writing software in (in descending order of 
familiarity) Rust, C, Zig, Elixir, Python and Java. I also have experience working
with NixOS and doing general Linux system administration. 

I'm passionate about high performance concurrent and parallel computing, 
distributed systems, free software, and helping make the web a more open and
decentralized place.
